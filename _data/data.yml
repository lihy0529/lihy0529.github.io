    summary: |
    
            Hi, I am <b>Haoyu</b> (Hao-yü, not "How-you". If you call me "How-you", then you must have called me thousands of times). You can call me Harry since most of you may have difficulty pronouncing my name :)
            
            I am a first-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://utns.cs.utexas.edu">UTNS</a> (UT Austin Networked Systems group), advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/">Aditya Akella</a> and <a href="https://daehyeok.kim">Daehyeok Kim</a>. My current research interests are <b>networks, architectures, operating systems and machine learning</b>. Specifically, I am interested in designing an efficient network system to boost ML training (<b>MLSys</b>), as well as using ML methodology to help system design (<b>LDOS</b>). Our projects often work on <b>programmable switch, smart NIC, FPGA and Linux kernel</b>.

            Previously, I spent four fantastic undergrad years in CS <a href="https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm">Turing Class</a>, Peking University, worked closely with Prof. <a href="https://yangtonghome.github.io">Tong Yang</a>. My undergraduate research interest lies in <b>databases (DB)</b> and <b>theoretical computer science (TCS)</b>. Although I foucs on theory and design, evaluation are conduced in <b>real database systems like RocksDB and Apache Flink</b>. This research area calls for students with strong interests, unique ideas and (maybe a little bit) mathematical foundation.

            <b>If you want to collaborate with me (see the last sentences of above two paragraphs), please feel free to contact my email lhy AT utexas DOT edu.</b>

            <b>Personal:</b>
            
            I like <b>psychology and photograph</b>. For the future five years, I want to learn foreign languages like Spanish and German, as well as pickup an instrument. 
            
            I also want to practice my cooking skill further because the food in UT is too high in calories.

            <b>Finally, I am 6.79 feets tall and I don't play basketball.</b>
